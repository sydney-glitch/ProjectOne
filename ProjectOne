<strong>Dear John Smith</strong>,
We are pleased to report that you have been excepted in our "Doctorate of Astronomy" program.
Please be sure to notify the admissions office if you choose to attend this fall. If you do not plan to attend this fall, please notify admissions office, and discuss later start dates that may work better for you. You are able to start the program every eight weeks, but if you wait longer
than a year from this acceptance later, you will need to re-apply for the program. The financial aid deadline will be August 15, 2020 for classes that start on August 18th.
Start dates are listed below.
</p>

<li> Fall I start date: <time datetime= "2020-08-18"> 18 August 2020</li>
<li> Fall II start date: <time datetime= "2020-10-06"> 06 October 2020</li>
<li> Spring I start date: <time datetime= "2021-01-10"> 10 January 2021</li>
<li>Spring II start date: <time datetime="2021-02-28"> 28 February 2021</li>

<p>
Once you have determined your start date, please let us know what you decide. We will assign you an academic advisor as soon as we know your plans.
The academic advisor will then assist you in picking your class schedule. This program is 10 months long, however, you may go at your own pace.
You and your advisor will be able to work out a plan that works best for you. He/she will let you know how long the program will take you
depending on how many classes you take at a time. You are allowed to take three classes each semester. Please keep in mind, that since this is
a doctorate program, the academic requirements may be more extensive than previous programs you have excelled in before.
We require:</p>

<li> You must maintain a GPA of 3.5 </li>
<li> You may not receive lower than a C in a course</li>
<li> You must complete all course to be eligable for graduation</li>

<p>
If you find yourself with any further questions, please contact me. My contact information has been provided at the begining of the e-mail. We look forward
to hearing from you.

University of Science motto: You have it, We doctorate.
Sincerely.
Dr. Sydney Somers
